# Project Title

GlobalErrorHandling

## Description

This simple solution tries to outline an easy way to handle exceptions in a .NET 8 Web API project.
2 different handlers have been implemented:
- Validation: intercepts all the exceptions caused by failed data validations performed by FluentValidation. It is an example for more fine grained control over the exception handling.
- Global: handles all the exception that have not been intercepted by other exception handlers.
